# TrackMyHours

I am created this project for personal use, but I might as well make it public as others may need something like this.
Will maby add more detailed install instructions later.

It's not hard to install though, you need:
* Composer
* Node/NPM
* MySQL (Or other DBs supported by laravel, you have to change the config yourself)
* Webserver to serve both 'backend/public' for API and frontend (you need to build the angular app first, so serve what ever folder you build it to)

See https://laravel.com/docs/6.0 for Laravel requirements.

Also see further install instructions in Laravel docs.
